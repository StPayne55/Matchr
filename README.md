Matchr uses the widely accepted psychological principle known as “The Matching Hypothesis” to match users with potential mates in their area.

The matching hypothesis (also known as the matching phenomenon) was first proposed by Elaine Hatfield and her colleagues in 1966. It claims that people are more likely to form and succeed in a committed relationship with someone who is equally socially desirable. So how can we determine desirability in society? Well, Matchr solves this by having the entire user community rate each other! Then users with similar ratings are matched. If a pair of matched users both like each other, then they'll be able to exchange info in the app.
